# Keras Tutorials

- Just a repo with codes for various tasks using Keras/Tensorflow.
- Most of them so far are from [keras](keras.io) but more will be added as and when I learn about tasks myself. 
- Many codes are not true to the original repos.
- This is by no means comprehensive, but should be easy enough to take the codes for a specific task and get a concept working ASAP.

## A huge thank you to

- [keras.io](https://keras.io/examples/)

## FAQ
- Why are there notebook and py files for the same thing? Well. I prefer running things using py files and VSCode's IPython extension. Many others love notebooks. Each to their own. 
All the notebooks are auto generated and so have no inputs
