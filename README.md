# Keras Tutorials

- Just a repo with codes for various tasks using Keras/Tensorflow.
- Most of them so far are from [keras](keras.io) but more will be added as and when I learn about tasks myself. 
- Many codes are not true to the original repos.
- This is by no means comprehensive, but should be easy enough to take the codes for a specific task and get a concept working ASAP.

All the notebooks are auto generated and so have no inputs
